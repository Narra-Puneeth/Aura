Low sugar, naturally oil-free, and can be made banana-free too.\n\n![A large white tray of vegan baked oatmeal studded with blueberries.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-23.jpg)\n\n**Baked oatmeal** is such a great healthy breakfast.\n\n**Made with minimal ingredients**, it's easy to prepare and making a batch means you'll have breakfast all week long (just like with my **[blueberry overnight oats](https://vancouverwithlove.com/blueberry-overnight-oats/)**).\n\nOil free, low sugar, gluten free and with a **banana-free option** too, it's a really versatile recipe that will be popular with the whole family.\n\nWhen I have busy mornings this is my go-to breakfast. I'll bake it at the beginning of the week, cut it into portions and then keep it in the fridge for the week ahead.\n\nServed with coconut yoghurt or **[coconut whipped cream](https://vancouverwithlove.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream-vegan-gluten-free/)** and fresh berries or **[fruit compote](https://vancouverwithlove.com/cherry-compote/)**, it's delicious.\n\n![A large tray of vegan baked oats cut into pieces.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oats.jpg)\n\n## Why this works\n\n**Just 6 ingredients** - Oats, banana (can be subbed if you're not a fan), baking powder, milk, maple syrup and blueberries. All simple, wholesome ingredients.\n\n**Quick and easy** - This recipe just requires mixing ingredients together and baking in the oven. Simple as that. It also needs minimal equipment - just a mixing bowl and an ovenproof dish.\n\n**Great for meal prep** - Because it yields 6 servings and is a great make-ahead breakfast.\n\n**Healthy** - Oats are a great source of fibre and will fuel you for the day! Plus, you can add protein if you like to make the dish more filling (see note below).\n\n**Low sugar** - Bananas and a dash of maple syrup are the only sweeteners here. And you can omit the maple entirely if you prefer a less sweet version. (See note below on switching out bananas.)\n\n**Family-friendly** - Kids love baked oatmeal for breakfast! Especially when it's topped with fruit and coconut yoghurt.\n\n![A slice of vegan baked oatmeal on a plate surrounded by strawberries and blueberries, and being drizzled with maple syrup.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-20.jpg)\n\n## Ingredients\n\n**Oats** - I use old fashioned rolled oats because I like a slightly chewier texture, but feel free to use quick oats if you prefer. Use gluten-free oats if needed. I don't recommend using steel cut oats as they won't soak up as much liquid.\n\n**Ripe banana** - Bananas add natural sweetness and help bind the baked oatmeal. The riper the better! You want the bananas to mash easily, which green underripe ones don't always do. This recipe is a great way to use up those old bananas sitting in your fruit bowl!\n\n**Non-dairy milk** - Use your favourite (almond milk, oat, coconut, soy, cashew etc...). I've used soy here simply because it's what I had. You can even make your own, like my quick **[DIY Hemp Milk](https://vancouverwithlove.com/how-to-make-hemp-milk-2-ingredients-vegan/)**.\n\n**Blueberries** - These add a great flavour punch to the oats, and help you get in your daily servings of fruits and veggies. I like blueberries because they're versatile, but you can use any berries. Strawberries, blackberries and raspberries all work really well.\n\n**Baking powder** - Needed to help the oatmeal rise. Not absolutely essential if you don't have it, but I much prefer the result it gives!\n\n**Maple syrup** - For added sweetness. I love the taste of maple syrup, and I'm a big fan of it as an alternative to refined sugars. Any other liquid sweetener - agave, coconut nectar etc. - should also work well. (See note below on low sugar option.)\n\nGet my **once-monthly newsletter** with my latest recipes straight to your inbox!\n\n## Substitutions\n\n**Bananas** - If you're not a fan, you can sub 1 cup applesauce or pumpkin puree instead of the 2 ripe bananas. Something is needed to help the baked oats bind so I don't recommend omitting this ingredient entirely.\n\n**Blueberries** - You can omit the berries altogether if you don't like them, or you can swap them out for chocolate chips or nuts (see flavour combinations below).\n\n**Maple syrup/low sugar version** - The maple syrup can be omitted, or swapped for another liquid or low sugar sweetener if preferred (such as stevia, erythritol, monk fruit etc.).\n\nFollow packaging advice on your sweetener to determine how much you should use in place of maple.\n\n![Ingredients for vegan baked oatmeal: banana, oats, dairy-free milk, blueberries, maple syrup and baking powder.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/baked-oatmeal-ingredients.jpg)\n\n## Variations\n\nTry these alternate variations of the recipe:\n\n**Strawberry, raspberry or blackberry** - Switch out the blueberries for any other type of berry, or a mix!\n\n**Banana bread** - Use vegan chocolate chips instead of blueberries, and double the vanilla extract (might be my favourite version!).\n\n**Chocolate** - Switch the blueberries for vegan chocolate chips, and add 1 tablespoon cacao/cocoa powder to the mixture.\n\n**Peanut or almond butter** - Add 3 tablespoons almond or peanut butter to the mixture before stirring. You can keep or omit the blueberries, as you prefer.\n\n**Roasted nuts** - Switch the blueberries for roasted hazelnuts, walnuts or almonds.\n\n**Pumpkin pie** - Stir in a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the mixture before cooking for a cosy, fall-themed baked oatmeal!\n\n## Make it high protein\n\nI love adding protein to my vegan baked oats. I find it makes it a more satisfying breakfast and I stay full for longer. Try either of these two methods to increase the protein:\n\n**Add 2 scoops of your favourite protein powder** **to the mix** - you may need to add a little more milk if your protein powder dries the mixture out.\n\n**Add ¼ cup hemp seeds** - a great source of protein and minerals. Stir these into the mixture with all other ingredients.\n\n## How to make vegan baked oatmeal\n\n1) Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.\n\n![mashed banana in a mixing bowl, surrounded by bowls of oats, baking powder and blueberries.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mashed-banana-in-bowl.jpg)\n\n2) In a large mixing bowl, mash bananas with hands or a fork.\n\n![Ingredients for vegan baked oatmeal in a large bowl.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-ingredients.jpg)\n\n3) Add all remaining ingredients to mashed banana.\n\n![A mix of oats, dairy-free milk, blueberries, maple syrup, banana and baking powder in a bowl.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-14.jpg)\n\n4) Mix well to combine.\n\n![Vegan baked oatmeal in white dish scattered with blueberries, ready to be cooked.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/easy-baked-oatmeal.jpg)\n\n5) Pour oat mixture into a large 9-inch baking dish, and press extra berries into the top to decorate.\n\n![A large white tray of vegan baked oatmeal studded with blueberries.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-23.jpg)\n\n6) Bake in oven for 30 minutes or until golden and all milk has evaporated..\n\n7) Slice into pieces and serve with dairy-free yoghurt or [coconut whipped cream](https://vancouverwithlove.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream-vegan-gluten-free/), fresh fruit, extra berries, a drizzle of maple syrup and your favourite nut butter.\n\n*Check out myweb story showing you how to make this **[baked oats recipe.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/vegan-baked-oatmeal/)***\n\n## How to serve\n\nWhile baked oatmeal is absolutely delicious on its own, it's *really* good when you serve it with any of the following:\n\n## How to store vegan baked oatmeal\n\nThis vegan baked oatmeal can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for **up to one week**.\n\nSimply slice into pieces after cooling, store and reheat as needed. **(This baked oatmeal can be eaten at room temperature if desired.)**\n\n**It can also be frozen** - simply allow the baked oatmeal to cool, cut into pieces and store in an airtight bag/container. Do not freeze past 3 months.\n\n![A large white tray of vegan baked oatmeal cut into slices and studded with blueberries. A spoon has already taken a slice out.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vegan-baked-oatmeal-25.jpg)\n\n## FAQs\n\nBoth are healthy options for breakfast and contain fibre, vitamins and minerals. Baked oatmeal is essentially oatmeal that has been baked in the oven rather than cooked on the stove, so nutritional differences are minimal. (And this baked oatmeal recipe also contains no oil, unlike some others.)\n\nNo you don't. This vegan baked oatmeal is completely egg-free and uses banana, applesauce or pumpkin puree instead.\n\nNo! See my notes above. You can swap it for applesauce or pumpkin puree if preferred.\n\n## More oatmeal breakfast recipes\n\n![Cookie Dough Overnight Oats in a glass jar with chocolate chips.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cookie-dough-overnight-oats-5-500x500.jpg)\n![3 Ingredient Oatmeal Waffles on a plate decorated with strawberries and coconut whipped cream.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-ingredient-oatmeal-waffles-featured-500x500.jpg)\n![Golden turmeric oatmeal in a bowl decorated with mango, raspberries and banana slices.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/golden-turmeric-oatmeal-2-500x500.jpg)\n![A spoonful of tiramisu overnight oats is taken from a glass jar, decorated with coffee beans and cacao powder.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tiramisu-overnight-oats-26-500x500.jpg)\n![White oven dish of vegan baked oatmeal studded with blueberries.](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vegan-baked-oatmeal-3-150x150.jpg)\n\n## 6-Ingredient Vegan Baked Oatmeal\n\n### Special Equipment\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Optional - to add protein\n\n### Instructions\n\n### Notes\n\n### Nutritional information per serving\n\n*If you’ve tried this vegan baked oatmeal recipe, **please leave a comment** or tip for others below.*\n\n*I'd love to know how you’ve made it your own!*\n\n**Follow Vancouver with Love on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vancouverwithlove/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/vancouverwithlove/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vancouverwithlove)!**\n\nGet my **once-monthly newsletter** with my latest recipes straight to your inbox!\n\n*If you're a brand and love my work, learn more about **[Working with Me](https://vancouverwithlove.com/workwithme/)** and feel free to **[get in touch!](mailto:elizabeth@vancouverwithlove.com)***\n\n## Reader Interactions\n\n### Comments\n\nSarah\n\nJanuary 24, 2023 at 10:54 pm\n\n![5 stars](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)  \nNever would have thought to bake oatmeal instead of making it on the stove!

Yes, I was cooking mine on the stove for years before I realized I could bake it. 🙂 It works great as a frozen breakfast too so I hope you try it.\n\nBernice\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 12:48 am\n\nWhat excellent timing! I have two 'distressed' bananas and some raspberries that are just dying to be eaten. I'm going to add them to my baked oatmeal tomorrow morning.\n\nElizabeth\n\nJanuary 26, 2023 at 5:48 pm\n\nExcellent!

Thanks for a yummy recipe!\n\nElizabeth\n\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 4:24 pm\n\nThat sounds wonderful! I need to try those additions myself. And great call on the flax - I'm a big fan of adding a little more protein to recipes where possible. 🙂\n\nKasey\n\nJanuary 15, 2025 at 7:05 pm\n\nCan I add chia seeds?\n\nElizabeth\n\nJanuary 16, 2025 at 9:03 pm\n\nI don't see why not! I wouldn't add too many, but maybe a couple of tablespoons. 🙂\n\nKate\n\nMarch 18, 2025 at 8:02 am\n\nThis has been a fantastic freezer-friendly breakfast for busy work mornings, and it's super fast to make (to save time I just mix in two cups of frozen berries and don't bother decorating the top). It's a very adaptable recipe as well. Recently I needed to make a quick snack for my toddler. I only had one banana and I had run out of berries so I halved the recipe and added a diced up apple. It worked really well! I'm going to try a version with 1 cup of berries plus a grated carrot to get some extra veggies into my bub.\n\nElizabeth\n\nMarch 18, 2025 at 6:15 pm\n\nExcellent idea! I'm currently working on a carrot cake version myself so totally agree with wanting to add veggies. So happy to hear the recipe is toddler-friendly, and thank you for taking the time to leave this lovely review. 🙂\n\nKaz\n\nMarch 19, 2025 at 9:12 pm\n\nCould you throw in a couple of tbsps or so of peanut butter ?  \nThank you !\n\nElizabeth\n\nMarch 19, 2025 at 9:35 pm\n\nDefinitely! That would add to the flavour (and add a little protein) I'm sure. 🙂\n\nKelsey\n\nApril 15, 2025 at 3:34 pm\n\nI’m looking forward to trying this! Could I double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 dish? And if so, would i need to adjust the baking time? Thanks so much!\n\nElizabeth\n\nApril 15, 2025 at 5:51 pm\n\nYou can definitely double it! Given the size of the dish, it will make the oatmeal deeper than the recipe suggests, so I would likely recommend baking it for slightly longer - maybe just test it after 30 minutes and see if it needs longer. Just be aware that as it's going to be deeper, it might end up a bit less firm that normal. 🙂\n\nBethany\n\nSeptember 14, 2025 at 6:58 pm\n\nHi! Was going to use frozen tangerine for my fruit but they didn’t taste great so used pumpkin ~ then read that it can be used in place of bananas! So mines a bit gooey even though I baked it an hour! Wondering if I bake longer if it’ll firm up more? Either way it’s pretty good! Added pecans and coconut sugar on top!\n\nElizabeth\n\nSeptember 15, 2025 at 7:31 pm\n\nThanks so much for the feedback Bethany! Was it pureed pumpkin that you used? That would definitely make the whole thing gooier as it's such a soft texture (and even if not, pumpkin is pretty soft so yes, it would have had that effect!). I would stick to berries or firmer fruit (i.e. pieces of apple, pear etc.) to ensure that it doesn't get too soft.\n\nChristine\n\nSeptember 21, 2025 at 4:26 pm\n\n![5 stars](https://vancouverwithlove.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)  \nMy goodness this recipe was delicious!

If you’ve enjoyed my [Peanut Butter Oatmeal](https://www.purelykaylie.com/peanut-butter-oatmeal/) and [Chocolate Oatmeal](https://www.purelykaylie.com/chocolate-oatmeal/), you’ll absolutely love this **Banana Oatmeal**. Like the former recipes, this oatmeal bowl is sweet, thick, creamy, and totally delicious. It practically tastes like dessert for breakfast!\n\nThis stovetop oatmeal recipe uses pantry staples.

From start to finish, you can make this meal in 15 minutes or less.\n\nSince oatmeal is a hearty, high fiber breakfast, it provides long lasting energy that fuels your whole morning.

This includes rolled oats, almond milk, water, mashed banana, maple syrup (optional), vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt.\n\nNext, transfer the pot to a stovetop and cook over medium-high heat. Frequently stir the oatmeal so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook until thick and creamy, about 7-8 minutes. The longer you cook, the thicker and creamier it will become.\n\nThen, transfer the oatmeal to bowl(s). Add your favorite toppings, like fresh fruit, nut butter, granola, nuts, seeds, and more. Enjoy!\n\n![cooking banana oatmeal inside a black pot](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![cooking banana oatmeal inside a black pot](https://www.purelykaylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/banana-oatmeal-2.jpg)\n![banana oatmeal inside a black pot](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![banana oatmeal inside a black pot](https://www.purelykaylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/banana-oatmeal-3.jpg)\n\n## What can I put in my oatmeal?\n\nSwitch up this oatmeal recipe every time and you’ll never grow tired of it! Try any of the oatmeal mix-ins below.\n\n## What toppings are good on oatmeal?\n\nThere are endless options for oatmeal toppings. I’ve listed my favorite recommendations below.\n\n![simple banana oatmeal inside a speckled ceramic bowl](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![simple banana oatmeal inside a speckled ceramic bowl](https://www.purelykaylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/banana-oatmeal-6.jpg)\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\n**Is oatmeal with banana good for you?**\n\nAbsolutely! This banana oatmeal recipe is made with healthy ingredients. It is vegan, gluten-free, oil-free, and contains no refined sugar. It’s packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\n\n**Is banana oatmeal healthy for weight loss?**\n\nYes, banana oatmeal can be included in a healthy weight loss diet. Since oatmeal is a low calorie and high fiber breakfast, it helps you stay full for hours. Oats are a slow digesting carbohydrate, which is more satisfying than quick digesting carbohydrates (like cereal and toast).\n\n**What is the healthiest fruit to put in oatmeal?**\n\nAny type of fruit can be a healthy oatmeal topping. While these oats are made with mashed banana, you can add extra fruit on top. Try adding fresh berries for a boost of antioxidants and extra fiber.\n\n**Can I meal prep oatmeal?**\n\nYes, you can meal prep oatmeal! However, I do not recommend meal prepping hot oatmeal. Instead, meal prep overnight oats. Follow my [Banana Overnight Oats](https://www.purelykaylie.com/banana-overnight-oats/) recipe.\n\n**Can I save leftovers?**\n\nYes, you *can* save leftover oatmeal, but I don’t recommend it. This banana oatmeal is best enjoyed immediately after making it.\n\n![a wooden spoon scooping into a bowl of vegan banana oatmeal surrounded by bowls of rolled oats, sliced banana, almond milk, and maple syrup](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![a wooden spoon scooping into a bowl of vegan banana oatmeal surrounded by bowls of rolled oats, sliced banana, almond milk, and maple syrup](https://www.purelykaylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/banana-oatmeal-8.jpg)\n\n## More oatmeal recipes with banana\n\nIf you try this **Banana Oatmeal**, please let me know your thoughts by leaving a rating and comment below! **Ready for more?** Subscribe to my newsletter or follow along on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purelykaylie/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CBqb8i4dygE91cY7CUFpQ?)!\n\n![vegan banana oatmeal inside a speckled ceramic bowl](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![vegan banana oatmeal inside a speckled ceramic bowl](https://www.purelykaylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/banana-oatmeal-5-300x300.jpg)\n\n## Banana Oatmeal\n\n### Description\n\nThis banana oatmeal recipe is an easy and healthy breakfast idea!

I’m glad I don’t have to deal with ice cubes. I didn’t think I could use regular oats instead of instant. Three thumbs up before even making it. I added blueberries and omitted in cinnamon and vanilla. For me it was perfect. Both in the ease of making it and it was delicious. I look forward trying different variations.

Can you even taste the almond milk? I’m lactose intolerant and not a big fan of almond milk.\n\nHi Riley…yes, you can use any kind of milk you want. The reason I use almond milk is because it’s less calories. I have made this smoothie several times with 1% milk when I was out of almond milk and it’s very good. A little bit thicker, but still tasty.\n\n![5 stars](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='80'%20height='16'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2016'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![5 stars](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)  \nVery tasty  \nNeed weight loss recipes for breakfast\n\n![5 stars](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='80'%20height='16'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2016'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![5 stars](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)\n\nIt was very delicious i fast from Sunday 5 pm til Thursday 5pm and this is my meal replacement\n\n![5 stars](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='80'%20height='16'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2016'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![5 stars](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)  \nI am so happy to have found this recipe, which I have made countless times.

I also can’t use almond milk because I am sensitive to oxalic acid.

I appreciate the variety and additional comments. I like the simplicity of ingredients which also keeps calories down. I usually stick to blueberries and yogurt base. I like addition of oatmeal and almond milk. Also thinking to try peaches since they are in season now. Thank you!\n\nI too freeze bananas for a similar smoothie I make for my husband and I. (We add frozen kale to ours and water instead of the milk.) I have found that you can put the bananas immediately in a zip lock bag without having to freeze them first on the cookie sheet. If the bananas stick together, a quick bang on the counter top will break them apart. It works for us and will save one step. Or alternatively, you could put lay them flat in the zip lock bag not touching each other for the first few hours of freezing and that should keep them apart too. Like Ann, I usually break them up first (I do halves). The most important thing I’ve learned about freezing bananas is (like Ann says) take the peel off. The peel is very hard to get off once the banana is frozen.\n\nI am not feeling well. Chills and fever. I’m hungry but nothing makes me feel like eating except for this banana smoothie. It’s easy to digest and satisfying. Thank you for this recipe.\n\n![5 stars](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='80'%20height='16'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2016'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![5 stars](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/assets/icons/rating/stars-alt-5.svg)  \nI really liked this smoothie!

As long as you don’t have a reaction to too much potassium due to the bananas.\n\nTasty smoothie. I did put in a T of almond butter, and the second time I made it, I couldn’t come up with a good reason not to add a handful of spinach. More nutrition, doesn’t add calories, doesn’t alter the taste. Win-win.

My blender gave out and I haven’t replaced it, so I made it in the food processor the first time. The oats didn’t completely break down. This morning, I made it again, using a spare coffee grinder to grind the oats and then used the immersion blender to blend everything together.

I pulsed old fashion oats before adding other ingredients then added banana, almond milk and I was out of vanilla so substituted almond. I feel as if I’ve had a real treat. I’m diabetic so this is great though I could hardly believe 45 gm carb. But it’s better than a cookie, or dish of icecream and I’m satisfied.

I had all the other ingredients in the house so was a good start to the ‘Smoothie’ trend. Did not use all the other things from 2nd list. But I might buy some good quality protein powder to add in. Do you have any other Smoothies which are around 250 Calories?\n\nA tres abientot and thanks for your recipe.\n\nI meant ‘posts’. I love them all.\n\nI will definitely try your smoothie! I enjoy all your recipes. I faithfully make the cranberry citrus loaf every Christmas. My husband thinks it’s the best! Thank you for your wonderful post! Have a great week!\n\nHello! I’m interested I trying your banana oatmeal smoothie, but I have a question. Do u use uncooked oatmeal\n\nI’m sorry to be so late in answering this…I missed it! No…the oatmeal is uncooked. Enjoy!\n\nVery good, I shared 1/2 with my cross fitter son, he asked for another. Even tho we didn’t have quite a whole bananna he still loved it. I used all ingredients minus the protein powder. Took a screen shot for my smooth file.\n\nExcited to see if this smoothie helps me loose weight. Started going to the gym going on my second month now but it’s so hard to loose all the weight you gain. It’s so easy to gain but hard to loose it.. yesterday I tried the banana and oatmeal smoothie for the first time and loved it. Can’t wait to see if this really does work.But being “PATIENT” to see results is the hardest but can’t give up.\n\nHi Jessy! Hang in there and good luck with the weight loss!\n\nOk so this is a weight loss smoothie. WOW! Ill say. It taste just like a real milkshake with real ice cream. Like the ones u can get at baskin robins. So so Delicious.\n\nI have to say, this is my absolute favorite diet smoothie above all. Most other smoothies just about make me gag BC of the taste and what not but this one was quite pleasant. I added all ingredients including the optional ones and the flavor at the end was great. Highly recommend :)\n\nSounds good will have to try\n\nWondering about sugar count with banana in this smoothie. Trying to cut cholesterol.\n\nHi Susan…I’m sorry but I’m not sure about the sugar count. Bananas are different sizes so I would hate to guess.\n\nJust tried this and it is sooo good!! Thanks for sharing!!!\n\nI made this and it was so good! Though I didn’t use oatmeal as I can’t eat it but instead I used 1/4 cup of sliced toasted almonds and it’s amazing!\n\nOh my…almonds are a great idea. Thank you!\n\nI like it\n\nWhat kind of oatmeal?\n\nHi Cindy…I usually use the basic old fashioned oatmeal but instant would work too.\n\nI will try the cleanse, Ann. I will let you know how it goes!!! :)  \nThank you!\n\nDee\n\nThank you so very much, Ann!!! The girls at WW will be thrilled in the morning to receive this!!! I will try it w/o the PB!!! but I sure do like it with!!!\n\nHave a great week-end and again, Thank you bunches!!!  \nPink Hugs,  \nDee\n\nI absolutely love the oatmeal banana smoothie. The drink really fills me up. Thank you for sharing.\n\nCindee\n\nDear Ann\n\nLove this post. I want to try this yummy smoothie. May I ask you if the oats are uncooked before I try this smoothie? Can’t wait to try this!\n\nHi Elizabeth! Yes the oats are uncooked. I will add that to the recipe. Thank you!\n\nGood Morning Ann,  \nJust tried your smoothie. Yummy! I used my Ninja single serve container. Of course the banana wasn’t frozen (which I will do for tomorrow for a thicker smoothie). This will be for weight loss so I used the 1/2 scoop of Organic Protein.  \nThank you for sharing your recipe.\n\nYou will love it with frozen bananas…good luck with your weight loss!\n\nthis looks delicious. do you use quick oats for the banana smoothie?\n\nI have used both quick and regular uncooked oats. It doesn’t matter as far as I can tell!\n\nGood morning, Ann Could I ask a favor of you? I love how you share recipes, etc. but could I ask – please – for you to use a bold black or navy print as the grey is very light and makes it rather hard to see. especially those of us with vision problems. Thanks, Ann.  \nHave an awesome day!!  \nDee\n\nTo make my smoothies more satisfying and add enough protein, I use half a cup unsweetened almond milk and half a cup of plain Greek yogurt.\n\n![ann drake with millie the schnauzer from on sutton place](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1673'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201673'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![ann drake with millie the schnauzer from on sutton place](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ann-drake-with-millie-the-schnauzer-on-sutton-place-darker-hair.jpg)\n\n## WELCOME\n\n### On Sutton Place isn’t about an actual house or a specific location.\n\nIt’s a state of mind.\n\n![divider 2024](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1600'%20height='400'%20viewBox='0%200%201600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![divider 2024](https://www.onsuttonplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/divider-2024.png)\n\nIt’s about loving your home, and following your heart.
